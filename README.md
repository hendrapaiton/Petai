APIs, features, and data structures are subject to change without notice. We appreciate your understanding and welcome any feedback to help us improve.

## About The Project

Traditional POS systems often provide basic transaction capabilities but lack the specialized features needed by pet shop owners. Petai POS aims to fill this gap by offering a tailored solution that not only handles sales but also provides actionable insights through Artificial Intelligence.

Our mission is to empower SME pet shop owners with the same advanced tools used by large retail chains, helping them understand their business better, manage inventory efficiently, and build lasting relationships with their customers.

### Key Goals

- **Simplify Daily Operations:** Automate routine tasks so you can focus on what matters mostâ€”the pets and their owners.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** Leverage AI to turn your sales data into strategic advantages.
- **Be Affordable and Accessible:** Deliver a world-class solution that fits the budget of a small or medium-sized business.

## Features

- **Core POS Functionality**

  - Fast and intuitive transaction processing.
  - Product and service management.
  - Inventory tracking and stock alerts.
  - Customer profile management.
  - End-of-day sales reporting.

- **AI-Powered Insights**

  - **Smart Inventory:** AI-driven demand forecasting to recommend optimal stock levels and prevent overstocking or stockouts of popular items.
  - **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggest relevant products or services to customers based on their pet's profile and purchase history.
  - **Sales Trend Analysis:** Identify patterns in sales data to highlight best-selling products and peak business hours.

- **Designed for Pet Shops**
  - Support for services like grooming and boarding.
  - Simple, clean user interface that requires minimal training.
